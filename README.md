# LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C++ solutions for a wide range of problems from LeetCode.  
It is designed as a resource for developers, students, and coding enthusiasts who aim to strengthen their problem-solving skills while maintaining clean, efficient, and well-structured code.

The solutions here follow a consistent style, with a focus on readability, maintainability, and performance optimization. Each file corresponds to a specific problem and is implemented in C++ using modern programming practices.  
Wherever applicable, solutions make use of features introduced in recent C++ standards, while still keeping code understandable for beginners.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to serve as a structured reference for anyone who wants to:
- Improve their knowledge of data structures and algorithms.
- Prepare for coding interviews at top technology companies.
- Explore multiple approaches to solving the same problem.
- Understand trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity in different solutions.

By going through these solutions, you will not only improve your coding skills but also gain insight into how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized in a way that makes it easy to navigate and find solutions to specific topics or patterns.  
Each problem is placed in a separate `.cpp` file, following a clear and consistent naming convention.

- **Array Problems**  
  Covers a wide variety of challenges involving arrays, from basic traversal to complex transformations, sliding window techniques, and advanced optimizations.

- **String Problems**  
  Includes problems on string manipulation, pattern matching, parsing, and dynamic programming approaches for substring and subsequence analysis.

- **Linked List Problems**  
  Contains solutions for singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and advanced operations such as reversal, merging, cycle detection, and deep copy.

- **Tree and Binary Search Tree (BST) Problems**  
  Implements common and advanced operations on binary trees, N-ary trees, and BSTs including traversal (DFS, BFS), construction, balancing, and path-related problems.

- **Graph Problems**  
  Includes traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), cycle detection, topological sorting, and connectivity checks.

- **Dynamic Programming (DP) Problems**  
  Covers a large collection of DP problems including classic approaches (1D, 2D DP) and optimization techniques like space reduction, bit masking, and state compression.

- **Greedy Algorithm Problems**  
  Focused on problems where local optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution, with careful explanations of why greedy works in each case.

- **Backtracking Problems**  
  Includes problems on generating permutations, combinations, subsets, and solving constraint-based puzzles.

- **Bit Manipulation Problems**  
  Covers XOR tricks, bit masking, shifting operations, and techniques to optimize mathematical computations using bitwise operations.

- **Mathematical and Number Theory Problems**  
  Deals with prime numbers, GCD/LCM, modular arithmetic, combinatorics, and numerical patterns.

- **Heap / Priority Queue Problems**  
  Includes solutions for scheduling, top-K problems, streaming data analysis, and efficient sorting mechanisms.

- **Stack and Queue Problems**  
  Implements stack-based algorithms for expression parsing, monotonic stacks for range queries, and queue-based BFS solutions.

- **Advanced Data Structure Problems**  
  Uses segment trees, Fenwick trees, tries, and disjoint set union (DSU) for solving complex queries efficiently.

## Coding Style and Approach

All solutions follow these core principles:

1. **Clarity First**  
   Code is written to be easily readable by others, with clear variable names and logical separation of steps.

2. **Efficiency**  
   Whenever possible, algorithms are optimized to achieve better time and space complexity while avoiding unnecessary overhead.

3. **Modularity**  
   Larger problems are broken down into helper functions or classes to keep the main logic focused.

4. **Comments for Explanation**  
   Critical logic and key steps are explained with short, precise comments for quick understanding.

5. **Avoiding Over-Complexity**  
   Priority is given to solutions that are both correct and elegant, without unnecessary complication.

If you want, I can also make a **much longer** version of this README with extended descriptions for each topic, so it feels like a full **guidebook** rather than just a repository intro. That would make it two to three times longer than this one. Would you like me to extend it that way?
